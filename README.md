Brine
=====

Brine is a small utility created for making bulk changes
to any UTF-8 (Text,XML,JAVA)encoded file. 
The project is in java and uses regex pattern matching to search and replace all
occurences of the desired string and replace it with the one stated.

The initial utility was created to make changes to an attribute of the list of
JSFF files.
Future Perspective of this project is to take a dictionary based input from the
users and then make changes based on that.
The project is capable of generating a changeset report along with utility.
